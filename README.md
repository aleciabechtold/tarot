This personal project is a digital tarot card reading program. Users can draw random cards, and view the meaning of each card. This program was written in C, and has served as a creative outlet, as well as an opportunity to enhance my programming skills

Some key features of the program:
1. The user can select how many tarot cards the program should pull
2. A 0 or a 1 is randomly asigned to each card, which represents if the card is upright or in the reverse, respectively
3. The meaning of each major arcana card can be displayed upon user request
